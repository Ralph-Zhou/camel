    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "To find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that corresponds to \\(x^2y^6\\). This means we are looking for the values of \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) such that:\n- The power of \\(x\\) is 2\n- The power of \\(y\\) is 6\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up equations based on the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to find \\(k\\).\n3. Substitute \\(k\\) back into the general term to find the coefficient.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\n2. We need to find \\(k\\) such that the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) match \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^6\\):\n   - The term \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k}\\) contributes \\(x^{8-k}\\).\n   - The term \\(\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\\) contributes \\(y^k\\).\n\n   We want:\n   \\[\n   8 - k = 2 \\quad \\text{(for } x^2\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 6 \\quad \\text{(for } y^6\\text{)}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving \\(8 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 6\\).\n\n3. Now we substitute \\(k = 6\\) back into the general term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n- \\(\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\\)\n- \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} x^{2}\\)\n- \\(\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-1\\right)^{6} \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{y^6}{64}\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} x^2 \\cdot \\frac{y^6}{64}\n\\]\n\n4. Now, we calculate the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(28 \\cdot 9 = 252\\) and \\(25 \\cdot 64 = 1600\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nNow we simplify \\(\\frac{252}{1600}\\):\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600 is 4. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]",
    "how many r in strawberry?": "To determine how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we can follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This is a straightforward counting problem where we need to identify each instance of the letter \"r\" within the word.\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Write down the word \"strawberry.\"\n2. Identify each letter in the word.\n3. Count how many times the letter \"r\" appears.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. The word is \"strawberry.\"\n2. Let's break down the letters in the word:\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r\n   - r\n   - y\n\n3. Now, we count the occurrences of the letter \"r\":\n   - The first \"r\" is the 3rd letter.\n   - The second \"r\" is the 8th letter.\n   - The third \"r\" is the 9th letter.\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nAfter counting, we find that the letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
