    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of the term \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\). We need to find the numerical coefficient associated with the term \\(x^2y^6\\) after expanding the binomial expression.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Identify the Binomial Expansion Formula**: We will use the binomial theorem to expand \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\).\n2. **Determine the General Term**: The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\).\n3. **Find the Term Corresponding to \\(x^2y^6\\)**: We need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the term \\(x^2y^6\\) appears in the expansion.\n4. **Calculate the Coefficient**: Substitute the values into the general term formula to find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n\n1. **Binomial Expansion Formula**:\n   The binomial theorem states that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   For our problem, \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\), \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\).\n\n2. **General Term**:\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Term Corresponding to \\(x^2y^6\\)**:\n   We need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponents of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are 2 and 6, respectively.\n\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) in the general term is \\(8 - k\\). We want this to be 2:\n     \\[\n     8 - k = 2 \\implies k = 6\n     \\]\n   - The exponent of \\(y\\) in the general term is \\(k\\). We want this to be 6:\n     \\[\n     k = 6\n     \\]\n   So, \\(k = 6\\) gives us the term \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Coefficient**:\n   Substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the general term:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 x^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 y^6\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate each part:\n   - \\(\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\\)\n   - \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}\\)\n   - \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\\)\n\n   Combine these:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\times 9}{25 \\times 64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{1600} = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\\).",
