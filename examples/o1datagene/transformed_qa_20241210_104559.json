    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\), we will use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\). We need to find the specific term in the expansion that contains \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the term in the expansion that corresponds to \\(x^2y^6\\). This means we need to determine the values of \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) such that:\n\n- The power of \\(x\\) is 2.\n- The power of \\(y\\) is 6.\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up equations based on the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n3. Solve for \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\).\n4. Substitute \\(k\\) back into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify to get the final answer.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\n2. We need to find \\(k\\) such that the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) match \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^6\\):\n\n   - The power of \\(x\\) is \\(8-k\\) (from \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k}\\)).\n   - The power of \\(y\\) is \\(k\\) (from \\(\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\\)).\n\n   We set up the equations:\n\n   \\[\n   8 - k = 2 \\quad \\text{(for } x^2\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 6 \\quad \\text{(for } y^6\\text{)}\n   \\]\n\n3. Solving \\(8 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 6\\). This matches our requirement for \\(y\\) since \\(k = 6\\).\n\n4. Now we substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the general term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-6} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\n\n5. Calculate \\(\\binom{8}{6}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into \\(T_6\\):\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} y^{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}\\) and \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} x^{2} y^{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nNow we simplify \\(\\frac{252}{1600}\\):\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600 is 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"
