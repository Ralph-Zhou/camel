    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\nWe are asked to find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\). This is a binomial expansion problem, and we need to use the Binomial Theorem to solve it. The Binomial Theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\), \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \\(x^2y^6\\) and then determine its coefficient.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Identify the general term in the expansion**: Use the Binomial Theorem to write the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\).\n2. **Determine the exponents**: Find the values of \\(k\\) such that the term contains \\(x^2y^6\\).\n3. **Calculate the binomial coefficient**: Compute \\(\\binom{8}{k}\\) for the appropriate \\(k\\).\n4. **Compute the coefficient**: Multiply the binomial coefficient by the appropriate powers of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(-\\frac{y}{2}\\) to find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n\n1. **General term in the expansion**:\n   The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the exponents**:\n   We need the term to contain \\(x^2y^6\\). Therefore, we set:\n   \\[\n   (8 - k) = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = 6\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 6\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the binomial coefficient**:\n   The binomial coefficient for \\(k = 6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!2!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the coefficient**:\n   Substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the general term:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the powers:\n   \\[\n   28 \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 x^2 y^6\n   \\]\n   Calculate the numerical values:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}, \\quad \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n   Multiply these together with the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\times 9}{25 \\times 64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{1600} = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\\).",
    "how many r in strawberry?": "### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\nWe are asked to determine how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry\". This is a simple counting problem where we need to examine each letter in the word and count the occurrences of the letter \"r\".\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Write down the word**: Write the word \"strawberry\" clearly.\n2. **Identify and count the letter \"r\"**: Go through each letter in the word and count how many times the letter \"r\" appears.\n3. **Double-check the count**: Ensure that no \"r\" is missed or counted extra.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n\n1. **Write down the word**:\n   The word is \"strawberry\".\n\n2. **Identify and count the letter \"r\"**:\n   Let's go through each letter in \"strawberry\":\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r\n   - r\n   - y\n\n   Now, count the \"r\"s:\n   - The third letter is \"r\" (1st occurrence).\n   - The eighth letter is \"r\" (2nd occurrence).\n   - The ninth letter is \"r\" (3rd occurrence).\n\n3. **Double-check the count**:\n   Reviewing the word again:\n   - s (no \"r\")\n   - t (no \"r\")\n   - r (1)\n   - a (no \"r\")\n   - w (no \"r\")\n   - b (no \"r\")\n   - e (no \"r\")\n   - r (2)\n   - r (3)\n   - y (no \"r\")\n\n   The count of \"r\"s is confirmed to be 3.\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\n\nThe letter \"r\" appears \\(\\boxed{3}\\) times in the word \"strawberry\"."
