    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\nThe problem requires us to find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\). This is a binomial expansion problem where we need to identify the specific term that contains \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Binomial Theorem**: The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n\\) expands to:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\), \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\).\n\n2. **Identify the General Term**: The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Condition for \\(x^2y^6\\)**: We need the term where the exponents of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) match \\(2\\) and \\(6\\) respectively. This gives us:\n   \\[\n   (8-k) = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(k\\)**: From the condition \\(k = 6\\), we can verify that \\(8 - k = 2\\) holds true.\n\n5. **Substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the General Term**: Substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the general term to find the specific term containing \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Coefficient**: Simplify the term to isolate the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n\n1. **General Term with \\(k = 6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-6} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   Simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^2 \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Exponents**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 x^2 \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 x^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 y^6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Fractional Coefficients**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine All Coefficients**:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 28 \\times \\frac{9}{1600}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]",
