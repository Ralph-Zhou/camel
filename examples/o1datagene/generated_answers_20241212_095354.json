    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\nWe are tasked with finding the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\). The expression is a binomial raised to the 8th power, and we need to determine the specific term in the expansion that contains \\( x^2y^6 \\). The final answer should be expressed as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\), \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\nThe general term in the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( k \\) such that the term contains \\( x^2y^6 \\). This means:\n\n- The exponent of \\( x \\) in the term is \\( 8 - k \\), and we want this to be 2:\n\n\\[\n8 - k = 2 \\implies k = 6\n\\]\n\n- The exponent of \\( y \\) in the term is \\( k \\), and we want this to be 6:\n\n\\[\nk = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( k = 6 \\) is the value that gives us the term \\( x^2y^6 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n\nNow, we substitute \\( k = 6 \\) into the general term to find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSimplify each part:\n\n1. **Binomial Coefficient**:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n2. **First Part**:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 x^2 = \\frac{9}{25}x^2\n\\]\n\n3. **Second Part**:\n\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 y^6 = \\frac{1}{64}y^6\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply all the parts together:\n\n\\[\n28 \\times \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\times 9 \\times 1}{25 \\times 64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252}{1600} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]",
