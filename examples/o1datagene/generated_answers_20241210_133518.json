    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the terms needed\n\nWe need to find the term that contains \\( x^2y^6 \\). This means we need to determine the values of \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\) such that:\n\n- The power of \\( x \\) is 2.\n- The power of \\( y \\) is 6.\n\nFrom the expression \\( a^{n-k} \\) and \\( b^k \\):\n\n- The term \\( a^{n-k} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{n-k} \\) contributes \\( x^{n-k} \\).\n- The term \\( b^k = \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k \\) contributes \\( y^k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Set up equations\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[\nn - k = 2 \\quad \\text{(for } x^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 6 \\quad \\text{(for } y^6\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( k \\)\n\nFrom \\( k = 6 \\), we can substitute into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nn - 6 = 2 \\implies n = 8\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent since \\( n = 8 \\) is the total exponent in our original expression.\n\n### Step 4: Find the specific term\n\nNow we can find the specific term in the expansion corresponding to \\( k = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Term} = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-6} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. **Binomial coefficient**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} x^{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-1\\right)^{6} \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{y^{6}}{64} = \\frac{y^{6}}{64}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine everything\n\nNow we can combine all parts to find the coefficient of the term:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Term} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{y^{6}}{64} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25 \\cdot 64} x^{2} y^{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{1600} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplify the fraction\n\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600. The GCD is 4.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]",

We need to consider both uppercase and lowercase instances of the letter \"c.\" In this case, we will find both \"C\" and \"c\" since the sentence contains an uppercase \"C.\"\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n\n1. Write down the sentence: \"Circumstances can change quickly.\"\n2. Identify and isolate the letter \"c\" in the sentence.\n3. Count how many times \"c\" (both uppercase and lowercase) appears in the sentence.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n\n1. **Write down the sentence**: The sentence is \"Circumstances can change quickly.\"\n2. **Identify the letter \"c\"**: We will look at each letter in the sentence:\n   - C (1st occurrence)\n   - i\n   - r\n   - c (2nd occurrence)\n   - u\n   - m\n   - s\n   - t\n   - a\n   - n\n   - c (3rd occurrence)\n   - e\n   - s\n   - (space)\n   - c (4th occurrence)\n   - a\n   - n\n   - (space)\n   - c (5th occurrence)\n   - h\n   - a\n   - n\n   - g\n   - e\n   - (space)\n   - q\n   - u\n   - i\n   - c (6th occurrence)\n   - k\n   - l\n   - y\n   - .\n\n3. **Count the occurrences**: As we go through the letters, we find:\n   - The first \"C\" is in \"Circumstances.\"\n   - The second \"c\" is also in \"Circumstances.\"\n   - The third \"c\" is in \"circumstances.\"\n   - The fourth \"c\" is in \"can.\"\n   - The fifth \"c\" is in \"change.\"\n   - The sixth \"c\" is in \"quickly.\"\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\n\nAfter counting, we find that the letter \"c\" appears **6 times** in the sentence \"Circumstances can change quickly.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
