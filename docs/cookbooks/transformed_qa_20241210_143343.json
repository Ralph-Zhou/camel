    "instruction": "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction",
    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we will use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that contains \\( x^2y^6 \\). This means we need to determine the values of \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\) such that:\n- The power of \\( x \\) is 2.\n- The power of \\( y \\) is 6.\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up equations based on the powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n3. Solve for \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\).\n4. Substitute \\( k \\) into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   T_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n\n2. We need:\n   - The power of \\( x \\) from \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\) is \\( 8-k \\).\n   - The power of \\( y \\) from \\( \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k \\) is \\( k \\).\n\n   We want:\n   \\[\n   8-k = 2 \\quad \\text{(for } x^2\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 6 \\quad \\text{(for } y^6\\text{)}\n   \\]\n\n3. Solving \\( 8-k = 2 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   k = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. Now we substitute \\( k = 6 \\) into the general term:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-6} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n6. Now calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 \\) and \\( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n\n7. Combine these to find the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{1600}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n\n8. Simplify \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\):\n   - The GCD of 252 and 1600 is 4.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"
