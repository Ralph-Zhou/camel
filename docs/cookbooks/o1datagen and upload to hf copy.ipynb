Calculate \\\\( \\\\binom{8}{6} \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\binom{8}{6} = \\\\binom{8}{2} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\times 7}{2 \\\\times 1} = 28\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Now calculate \\\\( \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\right)^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^6 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{9}{25}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^6 = \\\\frac{1}{64}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Combine these to find the coefficient:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = 28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{25} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{64}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   = 28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{1600}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   = \\\\frac{252}{1600}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Simplify \\\\( \\\\frac{252}{1600} \\\\):\\n   - The GCD of 252 and 1600 is 4.\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{252 \\\\div 4}{1600 \\\\div 4} = \\\\frac{63}{400}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\\nThe coefficient of \\\\( x^2y^6 \\\\) in the expansion of \\\\( \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x - \\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^8 \\\\) is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{63}{400}}\\n\\\\]\\n        Answer 2: \\\\frac{63}{400}\\n        Just answer \"True\" or \"False\".\\n        '}]\n"

The general term in the expansion is given by:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_k = \\\\binom{8}{k} \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{8-k} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^k\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. We need:\\n   - The power of \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{8-k} \\\\) is \\\\( 8-k \\\\).\\n   - The power of \\\\( y \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^k \\\\) is \\\\( k \\\\).\\n\\n   We want:\\n   \\\\[\\n   8-k = 2 \\\\quad \\\\text{(for } x^2\\\\text{)}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   k = 6 \\\\quad \\\\text{(for } y^6\\\\text{)}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Solving \\\\( 8-k = 2 \\\\) gives:\\n   \\\\[\\n   k = 6\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Now we substitute \\\\( k = 6 \\\\) into the general term:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = \\\\binom{8}{6} \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{8-6} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^6\\n   \\\\]\\n   This simplifies to:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = \\\\binom{8}{6} \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{2} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^{6}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Calculate \\\\( \\\\binom{8}{6} \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\binom{8}{6} = \\\\binom{8}{2} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\times 7}{2 \\\\times 1} = 28\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Now calculate \\\\( \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\right)^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^6 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{9}{25}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^6 = \\\\frac{1}{64}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Combine these to find the coefficient:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = 28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{25} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{64}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   = 28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{1600}\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   = \\\\frac{252}{1600}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8.
