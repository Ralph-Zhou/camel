Express your answer as a common fraction\\n        Answer 1: To find the coefficient of \\\\(x^2y^6\\\\) in the expansion of \\\\(\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x - \\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^8\\\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(a + b)^n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\\\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIn our case, we can identify \\\\(a = \\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\) and \\\\(b = -\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\), and \\\\(n = 8\\\\). We want to find the specific term in the expansion that corresponds to \\\\(x^2y^6\\\\).\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\\nWe need to find the term in the expansion that contains \\\\(x^2\\\\) and \\\\(y^6\\\\). This means we need to determine the values of \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(n-k\\\\) such that:\\n- The power of \\\\(x\\\\) is 2.\\n- The power of \\\\(y\\\\) is 6.\\n\\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\\n2. Set up the equations based on the powers of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\).\\n3. Solve for \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(n-k\\\\).\\n4. Substitute \\\\(k\\\\) into the general term to find the coefficient.\\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\\n\\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_k = \\\\binom{8}{k} \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{8-k} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^k\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. We need to find \\\\(k\\\\) such that:\\n   - The power of \\\\(x\\\\) is \\\\(8-k = 2\\\\) (which means \\\\(k = 6\\\\)).\\n   - The power of \\\\(y\\\\) is \\\\(k = 6\\\\).\\n\\n3. Since \\\\(k = 6\\\\) satisfies both conditions, we can substitute \\\\(k\\\\) into the general term:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = \\\\binom{8}{6} \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{2} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^{6}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Now we compute \\\\(T_6\\\\):\\n   - Calculate \\\\(\\\\binom{8}{6}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\binom{8}{6} = \\\\binom{8}{2} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\times 7}{2 \\\\times 1} = 28\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Calculate \\\\(\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{2}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{5}x\\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{9}{25}x^2\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Calculate \\\\(\\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^{6}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\left(-\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^{6} = \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{6} \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^{6} = \\\\frac{y^6}{64}\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n5. Now combine these results:\\n   \\\\[\\n   T_6 = 28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{25} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{y^6}{64} \\\\cdot x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   - The coefficient of \\\\(x^2y^6\\\\) is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   28 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{25} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{64} = \\\\frac{28 \\\\cdot 9}{25 \\\\cdot 64}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Calculate the final coefficient:\\n   \\\\[\\n   28 \\\\cdot 9 = 252\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   25 \\\\cdot 64 = 1600\\n   \\\\]\\n   Thus, the coefficient is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{252}{1600}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7.

However, since \"strawberry\" is entirely lowercase, we will focus on that.\\n\\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\\n1. Write down the word \"strawberry.\"\\n2. Identify the letter we need to count, which is \"r.\"\\n3. Go through each letter in the word and count how many times \"r\" appears.\\n4. Provide the final count.\\n\\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\\n1. The word is \"strawberry.\"\\n2. We are looking for the letter \"r.\"\\n3. Now, let\\'s break down the word letter by letter:\\n   - s\\n   - t\\n   - r (1st occurrence)\\n   - a\\n   - w\\n   - b\\n   - e\\n   - r (2nd occurrence)\\n   - r (3rd occurrence)\\n   - y\\n\\n4. As we go through the letters, we find:\\n   - The first \"r\" is the 3rd letter.\\n   - The second \"r\" is the 8th letter.\\n   - The third \"r\" is the 9th letter.\\n\\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\\nAfter counting, we find that the letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\"\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{3}\\n\\\\]<|endoftext|>']"
